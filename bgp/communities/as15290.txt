CUSTOMER COMMUNITIES:

MTS Allstream customers may choose to affect our
local preference from their routers by setting their
routes with the following BGP communities:

    Community  Definition Description
    ---------  ---------- -----------
    (default)  Local preference = 100  customer
    15290:100  Local preference = 100  customer primary
    15290:90   Local preference = 90  customer back-up
    15290:30   Local preference = 30  customer fall-back

If a multi-homed customer sets the community to
15290:30,  MTS Allstream will prefer an announcement
from a peer over directly connected customer
