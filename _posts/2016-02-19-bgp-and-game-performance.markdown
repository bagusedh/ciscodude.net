The makers of League of Legends, Riot Games, have posted a very [interesting engineering blog](http://engineering.riotgames.com/news/fixing-internet-real-time-applications-part-ii) about how they've engineered their AS for optimal game performance.

They mention important things like, buying from a Tier 1 doesn't solve all your problems, and that peering at IX's is super critical to their success.
