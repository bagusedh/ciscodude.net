[XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) is an awesome webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. It often has UNIX shell jokes, and other sysadmin humour as well. One [particularly funny comic strip](http://xkcd.com/936/) focuses on how terrible passwords are for people to remember, but easy for computers to guess. 

I'm glad to see various implementations on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=xkcd+password&ref=opensearch). The project named [xkpa](https://github.com/beala/xkcd-password) is my favourite. Easy to pass on to users (prevents additional back and forth due to insanely complex generated passwords), as well as indicating passwords entropy and average time to crack.
