I recently started maintaining [this graph](/bgp/mb/asns/) which shows the total number of AS Numbers in Manitoba. You will notice the dramatic increase in 2013 and 2014. 

When I tweeted the link to this graph, I got a reply back from Andree Toonk (of [BGPmon.net](http://www.bgpmon.net/)) almost immediately:

He was completely right. The steep growth was a direct result of two IXP's starting in Winnipeg/Manitoba. 

After two years, approximately half of the 60 or so ASNs operating in Manitoba are currently peered at either [MBIX](http://www.mbix.ca/) or [WpgIX](http://wpgix.net/). There is approximately 1 Gbps of traffic being exchanged locally. The ironic thing is now that the Manitoba Research Network (MRNET) has peered at MBIX, most of the small and rural ISPs have better/closer access to the Universities than customers of the big players. I am interested to know if the increased local peering makes a difference at registration time.
