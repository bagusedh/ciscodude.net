Earlier this month the local Internet Exchange I'm involved with received some reports of spam coming from the MBIX Peering LAN IP space.

<script src="https://stat.ripe.net/widgets/widget_api.js"></script>

Normally an Internet Exchange's Peering LAN IP space is not announced to the world via BGP. Only participants who have a next-hop in that particular network need to know about its existence. 

Upon investigation it turns out that someone spun up this IP space via BGP somewhere and blasted out a bunch of spam from an IP that had "unassigned" reverse DNS.

AS-Paths Observed:

*	`9002 44050 131788`
*	`1299 44050 131788`
