Yesterday morning the company I own, Hextet Systems, was assigned AS 395089 from ARIN's pool of ASNs. By mid-afternoon I had turned up BGP with my first uptream for IPv6, and was advertising a /44. By 11PM I had finished setting up IPv4 BGP as well and was advertising my /24. I had succeeded in turning up an ASN fully on the very first day.

I've had the fun of setting up several accounts related to having an ASN.

*	BGPmon

And setting up new IRR records:

*	aut-num
*	route and route6 objects
*	[as-set AS-HEXTET](http://irrexplorer.nlnog.net/search/AS-HEXTET)
*	[IRR explorer](http://irrexplorer.nlnog.net/search/395089)

And purchasing a new domain name to use for technical info and reverse DNS on the edge for traceroutes.
