Theo has given talks on large network challenges from security to IPv6, to various user groups and conferences. Some presentations archived online include:

*	**BGP, some Python, and a DB**

	BSidesWpg, `2015-11-15`. [Online Slides](bsideswpg2015-mb-bgplogger) | [PDF](bsideswpg2015-mb-bgplogger.pdf) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1e7mPH8u6s) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/bsideswpg2015-mb-bgplogger) | [exabgp-logger](https://github.com/tbaschak/exabgp-logger)

	Presentation to be given at BSidesWpg 2015. How do services like BGPmon and Dyn provide Internet Intelligence? This talk will describe the process of building a small-scale BGP update logger, running it on a single AS, and then attempt to scale it up.

*	**SaltStack (for System Administrators)**

	Manitoba Unix Users Group, `2015-02-10`. [Online Slides](salt-muug) | [PDF](salt-muug.pdf) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/salt-muug)

	An overview for beginners who have never used SaltStack before. Covering everything from installation, basic commands, templating, states, pillars, and of course mass deployment/upgrades. 

*	**Managing Nagios Configs with Git**

	Undefined, `YYYY-MM-DD`. **incomplete** | [Online Slides](nagios-configs-with-git) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/nagios-configs-with-git)

	One of the complaints I often hear from people unfamiliar with Nagios is how complex the config files are. Why not keep your configs better backed up, and understand the changes being made to your monitoring ecosystem? Using Git solves both problems at once!

*	**IPv6 Introduction**

	Undefined Skullspace Hackathon, `YYYY-MM-DD`. **incomplete** | [Online Slides](ipv6-intro) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/ipv6-intro-presentation)

	Presentation being prepared for delivery at an upcoming Skullspace Hackathon. Topics to include: standards, addressing, subnetting, new IPv6 concepts (SLAAC, "Happy Eyes"), and a lengthy Q and A session.

*	**MFNERC Needs IPv6**

	Undefined Infrastructure Group Meeting, `YYYY-MM-DD`. [Online Slides](ipv6-mfnerc) | [PDF](ipv6-mfnerc.pdf) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/ipv6-mfnerc)

	Presentation being prepared for delivery at an upcoming MFNERC infrastructure group meeting. Topics to include: Internet Criticality, IPv4 Exhaustion, IPv6 Risks/Rewards, IPv6 Deployment Costs/Readiness, and a Q and A session.

*	**Metadata**

	CryptoParty Winnipeg, `2014-02-08`. [Online Slides](cryptoparty-metadata) | [PDF](cryptoparty-metadata.pdf) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/cryptoparty-metadata)

*	**Intro Linux Security 2**

	Canadian Cyber Defense Challenge Prep, `2014-01-25`. [Online Slides](intro-linux-security2) | [PDF](intro-linux-security2.pdf) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/intro-linux-security)

	Presentation delivered to a full classroom of interested highschool students, Skullspace Classroom.

*	**InfoSec from an ISPâ€™s Perspective**

	BSidesWpg, `2013-11-17`. [Online Slides](bsideswpg2013-infosecfromisp) | [PDF](bsideswpg2013-infosecfromisp.pdf) | [Youtube](http://youtu.be/qvall1kyNIg) | [Sources](https://github.com/tbaschak/bsideswpg2013-ISPInfoSec)
